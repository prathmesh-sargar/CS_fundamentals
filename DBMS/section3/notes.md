# 🧠 SECTION 3 — RELATIONAL MODEL + KEYS + CONSTRAINTS

---

### 📖 1. Relational Model (RM)

* The **Relational Model** organizes data in the form of **tables (relations)**.
* Each table = a **relation**, each row = a **tuple**, and each column = an **attribute**.
* It’s the backbone of all modern RDBMS like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc.

🧩 **Example:**

| Student_ID | Name      | Age | City   |
| ---------- | --------- | --- | ------ |
| 101        | Prathmesh | 21  | Pune   |
| 102        | Riya      | 22  | Mumbai |

💬 *In simple words:*

> “Relational Model = Data stored in tables + relationships between them using keys.”

---

### ⚙️ 2. Components of a Relation

| Component              | Meaning                         | Example                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Relation (Table)**   | Set of tuples (rows)            | Student table                        |
| **Tuple (Row)**        | One record                      | (101, Prathmesh, 21, Pune)           |
| **Attribute (Column)** | Property of entity              | Name, Age, City                      |
| **Domain**             | Allowed values for an attribute | Age → Integer (0–100)                |
| **Degree**             | No. of attributes in table      | 4 (Student_ID, Name, Age, City)      |
| **Cardinality**        | No. of tuples in table          | 2                                    |
| **Relation Schema**    | Structure of relation           | Student(Student_ID, Name, Age, City) |

🧠 *Remember:*

* Table name = **Relation name**
* Column names = **Attributes**
* Rows = **Tuples**

---

### ⚙️ 3. Properties of Relational Tables

1. Each table has a **unique name**.
2. Each **column name** in a table is unique.
3. Each **tuple (row)** is unique (no duplicates).
4. Order of rows and columns **doesn’t matter**.
5. Values in a cell are **atomic** (no multi-valued attributes).
6. Every table must follow **integrity constraints** to maintain consistency.

🧠 *In short:* One cell = one value only.

---

## 🔑 4. KEYS IN RELATIONAL MODEL

Keys are attributes (or combinations) used to **uniquely identify** tuples in a table.

Let’s break them all 👇

---

### 🧩 4.1 Super Key (SK)

* A **Super Key** is any combination of attributes that **uniquely identifies** a row.
* It can have extra, redundant attributes.

🧠 *Example:*
In `Student(Student_ID, Name, Phone)`
→ `{Student_ID}`, `{Student_ID, Name}`, `{Student_ID, Phone}` — all are Super Keys.

💬 *Think:* Super Key = Any key that uniquely identifies.

---

### 🧩 4.2 Candidate Key (CK)

* A **minimal super key**, i.e. smallest set of attributes that can uniquely identify each tuple.
* No attribute can be removed from it.

🧠 *Example:*
`Student(Student_ID, Name, Age)`
→ `Student_ID` alone can identify → so it’s a **Candidate Key**.

💬 *Tip:* There can be **multiple candidate keys** in one table.

---

### 🧩 4.3 Primary Key (PK)

* The **main candidate key** chosen to uniquely identify each record.
* Cannot be NULL or duplicate.

🧠 *Example:*
`Student_ID` is a Primary Key in Student table.

💬 *Rules:*
✅ Must be unique
✅ Cannot be NULL
✅ Only **one** Primary Key per table

---

### 🧩 4.4 Alternate Key (AK)

* All **Candidate Keys except Primary Key** are called Alternate Keys.

🧠 *Example:*
If both `Email` and `RollNo` can uniquely identify a student, and RollNo is PK →
→ Email becomes Alternate Key.

---

### 🧩 4.5 Foreign Key (FK)

* A key used to **link two tables**.
* It is a field in one table that refers to the **Primary Key of another**.

🧠 *Example:*

```
STUDENT(Student_ID, Name, Course_ID)
COURSE(Course_ID, Course_Name)
```

Here → `Course_ID` in STUDENT is a **Foreign Key** referencing COURSE.

💬 *In short:* FK creates **relationships** between tables.

---

### 🧩 4.6 Composite Key

* A **Primary Key formed using multiple attributes**.

🧠 *Example:*
`Student_Course(Student_ID, Course_ID, Marks)`
→ Both `Student_ID` + `Course_ID` together = unique row.
So, `{Student_ID, Course_ID}` = Composite Key.

---

### 🧩 4.7 Compound Key

* A **Primary Key** that is formed by combining **two or more Foreign Keys**.

🧠 *Example:*
If a table connects `Student` and `Course`, both FKs (Student_ID, Course_ID) form a **Compound Key**.

---

### 🧩 4.8 Surrogate Key

* An **artificial or synthetic key**, usually an **auto-incremented number** used as PK when no natural key exists.

🧠 *Example:*
`User_ID (1, 2, 3, …)` auto-generated by DB.

* Not derived from real data, purely for identification.

💬 *Tip:* Use surrogate keys in large databases for performance and simplicity.

---

## 🧱 5. INTEGRITY CONSTRAINTS

Integrity = correctness + consistency of data.
These are **rules that maintain accuracy** in the database.

---

### 🔹 5.1 Domain Constraint

* Restricts values allowed in a column.
* Example: Age must be between 0 and 100.

  ```sql
  CHECK (Age BETWEEN 0 AND 100);
  ```

💬 *Think:* Domain constraint defines *valid data type or range*.

---

### 🔹 5.2 Entity Integrity

* Ensures that each row in a table is uniquely identifiable.
* Every table **must have a Primary Key**.
* PK **can’t be NULL**.

🧠 *Example:* Every student must have a unique Student_ID.

---

### 🔹 5.3 Referential Integrity

* Ensures that **Foreign Key values match Primary Key values** of referenced table.
* No orphan or broken references allowed.

🧠 *Example:*
If `Course_ID` in STUDENT refers to COURSE table,
then Course_ID in STUDENT must exist in COURSE.

💬 *In short:*

> “A child record must have a valid parent.”

---

### 🔹 5.4 Key Constraints

These are **column-level restrictions** applied during table creation.

| Constraint      | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **NOT NULL**    | Column cannot be NULL                             |
| **UNIQUE**      | All values must be unique                         |
| **DEFAULT**     | Assigns default value if none is provided         |
| **CHECK**       | Validates data with condition                     |
| **PRIMARY KEY** | Uniquely identifies a row                         |
| **FOREIGN KEY** | Links two tables, maintains referential integrity |

🧠 *Example:*

```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_date DATE,
  customer_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);
```

✅ Supports relationships via Foreign Keys.
✅ High data integrity and consistency.
✅ Independence from physical storage details.
✅ Easy to scale, modify, and secure.

### ⚡ Quick Recap:

```
Table → Relation
Row → Tuple
Column → Attribute
Domain → Allowed values
Key → Uniquely identify rows
Constraint → Keep data consistent
```

**Q2:** What is the difference between Super Key and Candidate Key?
🗣️ *Say:*

> “A Super Key is any set of attributes that can uniquely identify a row, while a Candidate Key is a minimal Super Key with no redundant attributes.”

**Q3:** What is Referential Integrity?
🗣️ *Say:*
